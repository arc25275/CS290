			<!-- Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
			The index of a website often refers to the home page. This is usually
			called `index.html`, though it does not have to be, and can be named
			something else. This index page is what a website domain and server points
			to, and what is shown to users by default when opening the website.
			<br />
			<!-- Explain can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector tools. What is different about the file's details on the web server versus the local computer? -->
			The main difference from the local website vs the website on the
			engineering server is the network tab. On the local website, no requests
			are made, and it is simply shown to you. On the engineering server, it is
			actually hosted elsewhere, and requests have to be made to access
			resources like the index and other files
			<br />
			<!-- Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not. -->
			From looking at the network tab, it looks like if no favicon is provided,
			the engineering server one is used instead. This leads to it getting a 200
			status, meaning it is fine, and the resource was accessed. `main.css` and
			`main.js` give 404 errors, meaning that the files were not found, which
			makes sense as the HTML is pointing to files that don't exist.
			<br />
			<!-- Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What are the scheme, subdomain, host domain, and resources?  -->
			The URL for my file is
			`https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~clarka8/a1-clarka8/` The scheme of the
			url is `https://` meaning it a secure version of HTTP. The host is
			`web.engr.oregonstate.edu`, where `web.engr.` is the subdomain, and
			`oregonstate.edu` is the main domain. The path to the resource is
			`/~clarka8/a1-clarka8`, which shows that the file is within my user's
			`public_html` on the engineering server, and in a folder called
			a1-clarka8.
