			<!-- Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
			The index of a website often refers to the home page. This is usually
			called `index.html`, though it does not have to be, and can be named
			something else. This index page is what a website domain and server points
			to, and what is shown to users by default when opening the website.
